# Style and Testing Rules

## Language and Tooling
- TypeScript `strict: true`.
- ESLint and Prettier required; fix lint errors before merge.
- Vitest for unit and integration tests.

## TDD Workflow (Enforced)
1) Write tests first.
2) Write minimal code to satisfy tests.
3) Run tests.
4) Fix until green.

## Coverage and Quality Gates
- Coverage target: ≥80% lines for new or changed areas.
- Integration tests for key routes.
- On persistent failures, stop and request human review.
