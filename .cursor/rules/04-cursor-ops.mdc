# Cursor Operational Rules

- Respect `.cursorignore` at all times.
- Do not use "ask entire codebase" operations.
- Ask clarifying questions if context is missing.
- Use YOLO mode only after tests exist and only with explicit user approval.
- Cross-service calls must go through the nginx gateway over HTTP; no direct service imports.
- No controller talks directly to a repository. Preserve layering.
